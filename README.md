# Project Name or App Name
# Overview
In this section you will provide a detailed description of what the project is about or an overview of the application. 

Here is an example:

Tip calculator with an interactive interface. This is a program that takes in inputs of price and tip percentage and returns the price. The tip amount will be based on the tip percentage and the total bill. The program also allows the user to split the bill and will calculate those values in terms of order price, tip amount, and total amount.

# How It Works
In this section you will walk the reader through how the app works.

Example:

When a user enters the site, the site will record the day the invoice was issued and the due date of the payment will be two weeks from that time. These values will be populated automatically.

Users are given a few fields to fill out and a number of additional steps will occur when certain buttons are pressed. The possible input areas are Price and Tip values.
The number of individuals to split the bill can be by either: cash, credit, or check.

If credit is selected, a menu will prompt the user to input their credit card and CVV number. A validate button with the user's card information will then appear to allow the user to check if their card is accurate.

It checks to make sure the format is valid and to make sure the drop-down menu matches the card provider (i.e. Visa, MasterCard).

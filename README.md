# Project Name or App Name
# Overview
In this section you will provide a detailed description of what the project is about or an overview of the application. 

Here is an example:

Tip calculator with an interactive interface. This is a program that takes in inputs of price and tip percentage and returns the price. The tip amount will be based on the tip percentage and the total bill. The program also allows the user to split the bill and will calculate those values in terms of order price, tip amount, and total amount.

# How It Works
When the users first access the site, the time at which they accessed the site will be recorded as the day the invoice was issued, and the due date of the payment will be two weeks from that time. These values will be populated automatically.

Users will are given a few fields to fill out, and a number of consequences will occur when certain buttons are pressed. The possible input areas are:

Price and Tip values.
The number of individuals to split the bill by
Payment through cash, credit, or check.
If credit is selected, additional menus prompting the user to input their credit card and CVV number will be given. A validate button with the user's card information will then appear to allow for the user to check if their card works

It just checks to make sure that the format is valid - make sure the dropdown menu matches your card provider (i.e. Visa, MasterCard)if you want to try it out!
# Screenshot of Code
